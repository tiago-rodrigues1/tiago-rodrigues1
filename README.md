I'm a Bachelor's student in Information Technology at UFRN, with a technical degree in Informatics from the UFRN. I have a solid background in web development and am currently focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.

I've built full-stack applications using JavaScript, NextJS, and PHP, and I’m now diving deeper into AI — exploring areas like image processing, machine learning, and algorithmic problem-solving.
